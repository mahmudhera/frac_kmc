This was initially generated by cmake, but it generates absolute paths.
To make it easy to use I have changed it to relative and removed cmake files and configuration parts.
If there are any issues here one can regenerate this on windows as follows (from this dir).
cd ..
mkdir build2
cd build2
cmake ..

and the cmake's vs project should be regenerated
